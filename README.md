# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)


# Types of Problems and Tasks
**Supervised learning:** The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.

**Unsupervised learning:** No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).

**Reinforcement learning:** A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent[4]:3). The program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space.

# Focusing on each types of learning
## Supervised Learning
Run through example on scikit-learn[Python]

## Unsupervised Learning
Given a set of data, can we cluster it (introduction on scikit-learn):

Quick Summary:
1. Define your metrics of success [False Positive vs. False Negative]
2. To test your algorithm, you need training data, development data [tuning algorithm], and test data
